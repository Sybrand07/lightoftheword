    <p>In Genesis 40, Joseph interprets dreams in prison, showing God's providence. He explains the dreams of Pharaoh's cupbearer and baker, predicting their fates. Despite being forgotten by the cupbearer, Joseph remains faithful, trusting in God's plan. The chapter encourages patience, giving glory to God, and seeing divine delays as opportunities for God's greater plan.</p>
