    <p>The names of God in the Bible reveal His nature and character throughout history. From Elohim as the Creator to Immanuel as "God with us" in Jesus Christ, God's ultimate desire is to be present with His people. Jesus embodies all these names, showing God's desire for relationship and salvation.</p>
