    <p>In order to identify God's voice in your life, it is important to be still and quiet in His presence. His communication may come in the form of inner impressions, peace or clarity about a situation, scriptures brought to mind, gentle promptings, a sense of conviction or leading, creative ideas or solutions, a deep sense of assurance or presence, or a desire for further action. God's voice brings peace, clarity, and conviction, aligning with scripture and bringing a sense of calm assurance. By growing in sensitivity to the Holy Spirit, you can begin to recognize when God is speaking to you in these subtle ways.</p>
