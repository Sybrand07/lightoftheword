    <p>In Genesis 32:24-30, Jacob wrestles with God and receives a new name, Israel, symbolizing his transformed identity from a deceiver to one who clings to God. The wrestling represents his lifelong struggle and the importance of dependence on God. Through brokenness comes blessing, highlighting the power of perseverance in prayer.</p>
