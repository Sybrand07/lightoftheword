    <p>Genesis 29:17 contrasts Leah's "tender-eyed" appearance with Rachel's beauty. The Hebrew phrase used, רַךּוֹת עֵינַיִם, suggests softness or gentleness. While Jacob loved Rachel, God blessed Leah with many children, including Judah, highlighting a deeper spiritual theme of God valuing inner qualities over outward beauty. Leah's story teaches us valuable lessons.</p>
