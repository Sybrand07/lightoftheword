    <p>Genesis 27:40 foretells the breaking of Esau's yoke by his descendants. Possible fulfillments include King David's conquest, Edom's rebellion under King Jehoram, and the Hasmonean conquest. Ultimately, Edom was absorbed into Israel and lost its distinct identity by the time of Christ. The yoke was broken around 850 BC.</p>
