    <p>The talk explores the connection between John 14 and God dwelling with humanity, seen through the biblical theme of divine dwelling. From the Tabernacle in Exodus to the New Jerusalem in Revelation, God's desire to dwell among His people is fulfilled through Jesus and the Holy Spirit, with a promise of eternal communion in the future.</p>
