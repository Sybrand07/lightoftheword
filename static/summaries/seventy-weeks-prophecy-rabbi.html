    <p>Rabbinical interpretations of the Seventy-Weeks Prophecy in Daniel 9 focus on Israel's redemption, the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and the role of the Anointed One. The timeline is viewed symbolically, with a focus on historical events and future restoration. Differences from Christian views include a broader focus on earthly restoration and the future arrival of a Jewish Messiah.</p>
