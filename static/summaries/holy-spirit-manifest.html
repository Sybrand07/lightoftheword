    <p>The Holy Spirit manifests in people in different ways depending on their faith, openness to Him, and God's purpose. His manifestations include convicting of sin, spiritual gifts, fruits of the Spirit, deepening worship, supernatural boldness, dreams, visions, and more. Factors influencing His manifestation include faith, surrender, spiritual hunger, God's will, obedience, calling, faith community, and atmosphere. God desires to manifest His Spirit in all believers, requiring a willing heart to receive, trust, and yield.</p>
