    <p>In Genesis 3:16, God pronounced judgments on women after Adam and Eve's disobedience. Christ's sacrifice on the cross brings redemption, but the effects of the Fall remain. Pain in childbearing, desire for husband, and husband's rule are affected. In Christ, relationships can be restored, suffering transformed, and gender dynamics reversed.</p>
