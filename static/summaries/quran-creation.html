    <p>In summary, the Quran does have a creation narrative, but it differs from the Bible in structure and details. It mentions creation in six days, creation from water, Adam from clay, and the fall of Adam and Eve. However, it differs on original sin, Eve's creation, and the order of creation events.</p>
