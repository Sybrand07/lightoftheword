    <p>Genesis in the Bible uses the Hebrew word "bara" to emphasize God's unique act of creation, bringing things into being from nothing. This contrasts with "asah," meaning making or forming from existing material. Genesis 2:7 shows God forming man from dust, which does not contradict the ex nihilo creation in Genesis 1:1.</p>
