    <p>Genesis 2 provides insights into why God made humans, highlighting the importance of reflecting His image, having intimate fellowship with Him, stewarding creation, experiencing love and community, living under His moral order, and filling the earth with His glory. Despite the Fall, God's redemptive plan restores humanity to fulfill their original purpose of dwelling with Him in perfect fellowship.</p>
