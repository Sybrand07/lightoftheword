    <p>The debate over the meaning of "desire" in Genesis 3:16 has two main interpretations: control/domination or longing/dependence. Both suggest a distortion of God's design for marriage. However, in Christ, this effect is removed through mutual submission, restoration of identity, and healing of power struggles. This redemption overcomes the relational struggles described in Genesis 3:16.</p>
