    <p>1 Corinthians 7:36 can be interpreted in two main ways: as addressing a betrothed man struggling with marriage decisions, or as giving parents the authority to decide on their daughter's marriage. The betrothed interpretation is more widely accepted today due to the context and language used in the passage. However, the father interpretation was more common in ancient times.</p>
