    <p>Signs leading up to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, as recorded in the Talmud, indicated that God had ceased to accept the sacrifices. Events such as the failure of the scarlet thread to turn white, the cessation of the Menorah's oil miracle, and corruption in the High Priesthood, pointed to divine disfavor with the sacrificial system. These signs align with the Christian belief that Jesus' crucifixion in 30 AD marked the end of the old covenant and the beginning of the new covenant.</p>
