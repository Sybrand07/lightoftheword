    <p>Being filled with the Holy Spirit means experiencing God's active presence in and through a believer, empowering them for holiness, boldness, and service to God. This filling was first seen at Pentecost, with various signs and manifestations like speaking in tongues, prophetic speech, and supernatural encounters. The purpose is to empower believers for witness, transform character, and demonstrate God's power. It is an ongoing relationship where believers walk in step with the Spirit, use spiritual gifts, engage in spiritual warfare, and have greater love for people. Speaking in tongues is a supernatural ability given by the Holy Spirit for edification, communication with God, as a sign for unbelievers, and for corporate worship. Many believers throughout history have shared powerful testimonies of being filled with the Spirit. To receive the Holy Spirit's filling, one must ask in faith, repent and yield, worship and pray, possibly receive the laying on of hands, and step out in faith. Ultimately, being filled with the Holy Spirit is a life-changing experience that leads to a transformed life and intimacy with God.</p>
