    <p>Summary: Joseph, from the Bible, is linked to divination in Genesis 44. However, his use of a silver cup is likely a test rather than actual practice. In contrast to divination, Joseph attributes his wisdom to God. Hydromancy, a form of divination using water, was practiced in ancient cultures like Egypt.</p>
