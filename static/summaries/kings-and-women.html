    <p>The practice of "taking a woman into your household" in ancient Near Eastern culture often meant marriage or concubinage. Kings did this for political alliances, cultural norms, and to provide protection for women. In Genesis 20, Abimelech took Sarah into his household, but God intervened before any physical relations could occur.</p>
