    <p>The Arab-Israel conflict stems from the division between Ishmael and Isaac's descendants, with historical, political, and spiritual dimensions. Biblical origins, ancient conflicts, and the rise of Islam have all contributed to the ongoing tensions. Despite future prophecies of war, there is hope for reconciliation through the spread of the gospel among Ishmael's descendants.</p>
