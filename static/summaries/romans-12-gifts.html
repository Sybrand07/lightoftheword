    <p>Romans 12 reminds us that we all have different gifts given by grace. We should use them accordingly: prophecy, service, teaching, exhortation, contribution, leadership, and mercy. Each gift serves a specific purpose in sharing God's love and should be used with faith, generosity, zeal, and cheerfulness.</p>
