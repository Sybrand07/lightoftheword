    <p>In Genesis 28:12, Jacob dreams of a ladder connecting heaven and earth, symbolizing God's presence and guidance. Some argue it could be a staircase or ramp. Regardless, Jesus is seen as the true ladder. The vision assures Jacob of God's promises. The significance lies in the direct connection between heaven and earth.</p>
