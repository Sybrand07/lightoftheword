    <p>Battle against intrusive thoughts by relying on scripture. Remember that the Spirit of God gives us power, love, and self-discipline. Take captive every thought and make it obedient to Christ. Be anxious for nothing, pray with thanksgiving, and let God's peace guard your heart and mind. Renew your mind and put on the new self created to be like God. Guard your heart, for everything flows from it.</p>
