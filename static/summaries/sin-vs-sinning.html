    <p>1 John 3:8 discusses the purpose of Jesus Christ's mission to overcome sin and the power of the devil. Different translations emphasize continuous or habitual sinning. The original Greek suggests ongoing actions rather than a one-time sin. The verse highlights the importance of living a transformed life in Christ.</p>
