    <p>Genesis 47 tells the story of Joseph's strategic leadership in Egypt during a time of crisis. By centralizing power under Pharaoh and implementing a formalized tax system, Joseph not only saved lives but also laid the foundation for Egypt's economic structure for generations. His actions reflect the power of divine wisdom in governance and the biblical principle of stewardship. Joseph's legacy as an economic genius and transformative leader continues to influence civilizations to this day.</p>
