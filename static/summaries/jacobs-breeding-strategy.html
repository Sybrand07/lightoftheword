<body style="font-family: Montserrat;">
    <p>Jacob's breeding strategy in Genesis 30 focused on increasing his wealth by selectively breeding livestock for his father-in-law Laban. Despite Laban's attempts to cheat him, Jacob used a combination of negotiation, selective breeding techniques, and divine intervention to succeed. This story teaches lessons in negotiation, diligence, strategy, and the importance of divine favor for success.</p>
