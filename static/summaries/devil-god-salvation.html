    <p>The Bible does not explicitly state if the devil knew about God's plan for salvation. The devil's knowledge was limited, and prophecies hinted at his defeat. However, his actions suggest he did not fully understand God's plan. Ultimately, God's wisdom and sovereignty prevailed, using even Satan's actions for good.</p>
