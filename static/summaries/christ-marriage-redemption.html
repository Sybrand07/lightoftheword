    <p>Summary: Christ's redemption transforms marriage by moving couples from power struggles to mutual submission, unhealthy dependence to Christ-centered security, and brokenness to healing and oneness. By following Christ's example of sacrificial love and unity, couples can find restoration and fulfillment in their relationship. Believers must actively choose to live in God's design for marriage, rather than in the patterns of sin and control outlined in Genesis 3:16.</p>
