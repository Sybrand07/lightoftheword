    <p>The Quran portrays the role of a wife as a partner, source of comfort, and significant part of the family unit. It emphasizes mutual love, mercy, and cooperation between husband and wife, while also addressing responsibilities and rights in marriage, promoting respect, equality, financial security, and fair treatment in divorce.</p>
