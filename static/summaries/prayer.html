    <p>The word "pray" originates from Latin and Old French, meaning to ask or entreat. It is a powerful tool for communicating with God, seeking guidance, offering praise, and seeking forgiveness. Across cultures and religions, prayer signifies a connection, surrender, and dialogue with a higher power. Ultimately, it reflects humanity's universal desire for connection, guidance, and support.</p>
