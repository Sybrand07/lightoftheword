    <p>High places and green trees were often associated with idolatry in the Bible. These locations were used for worship of foreign gods and goddesses, leading to spiritual unfaithfulness among the Israelites. Additionally, other places like household shrines, the Temple, and objects like the bronze serpent were also misused for idol worship, highlighting humanity's tendency to drift from pure worship. The prophets and faithful leaders tried to reform Israel by tearing down these altars and idols, urging the people to worship God as He commanded.</p>
