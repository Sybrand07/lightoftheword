    <p>The Bible likely used a 360-day year in some calculations, based on references to 30-day months. However, it's uncertain if this applied to people's ages. While ancient civilizations transitioned to a 365-day solar year, the Hebrews used a lunar-solar calendar. Lifespans in the Bible are consistent regardless of year length.</p>
