<h4>When Was Esau's Yoke Broken?</h4>
<p>Genesis 27:40 (KJV) states:</p>
<blockquote>"And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother; and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion, that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck."</blockquote>
<p>This prophecy speaks of Esau’s descendants (Edom) being under Israel's rule and later breaking free.</p>

<h4>Historical Fulfillments</h4>
<p><strong>Under Israelite Rule – King David (c. 1000 BC)</strong></p>
<p>2 Samuel 8:14 records that David conquered Edom and placed garrisons in their land, fulfilling the prophecy that Esau would serve Jacob.</p>

<p><strong>Breaking the Yoke – Edom’s Rebellion (c. 850 BC)</strong></p>
<p>During King Jehoram’s reign (2 Kings 8:20-22), Edom revolted against Judah and established its own king, marking the moment Esau's descendants broke free.</p>

<p><strong>The Hasmonean Conquest (c. 130 BC)</strong></p>
<p>John Hyrcanus I later conquered Edom (Idumea), integrating them into Jewish society. By the Roman era, Edom had fully merged with Israel, and its distinct identity disappeared.</p>

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p>The yoke was broken around 850 BC when Edom gained independence, but over time, Esau’s lineage was absorbed into Israel, ceasing to exist as a separate nation.</p>
