     font-family:Montserrat'>Role in Abraham's Household:</span></b><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Montserrat'><br>
     Eliezer was a highly trusted servant in Abraham's household. His
     responsibilities were significant, and he managed many of Abraham's
     affairs. This trust is underscored by his later role in Genesis 24, where
     he is entrusted with the critical mission of finding a suitable wife for
     Isaac.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:13.5pt;
font-family:Montserrat'>Why Was He Considered the Heir?</span></b></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     font-family:Montserrat'>Lack of a Biological Heir:</span></b><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Montserrat'><br>
     In Genesis 15:2, Abraham laments that he remains childless and states,
     'what will you give me, seeing I go childless, and the heir of my house is
     Eliezer of Damascus?' In the absence of a biological son, it was customary
     in that cultural context for a trusted servant or relative to be
     designated as the heir.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     font-family:Montserrat'>Trust and Responsibility:</span></b><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Montserrat'><br>
     Eliezer's designation as heir reflects the deep trust and reliance Abraham
     placed in him. As the steward of Abraham's estate, Eliezer was naturally
     considered the most suitable candidate to inherit and manage Abraham's
     household if no son were born.</span></li>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     font-family:Montserrat'>Divine Promise Reoriented the Heirship:</span></b><span
     style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Montserrat'><br>
     Although Eliezer was seen as the natural heir under the circumstances, God
     later promised Abraham a son. The birth of Isaac shifted the focus of the
     covenantal promise, and Isaac became the rightful heir of Abraham's
     legacy.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Montserrat'>In Genesis 24 the narrative focuses on Abraham's
trusted servant who is tasked with finding a wife for Isaac. Although the text
in many translations does not explicitly name him as 'Eliezer,' traditional
interpretation identifies him as the same Eliezer of Damascus mentioned in
Genesis 15:2. For example:</span></p>

<ul type=disc>
 <li class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><b><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
     font-family:Montserrat'>Genesis 24:2:</span></b><span style='font-size:
     12.0pt;font-family:Montserrat'> Abraham instructs his 'elder servant, who
     ruled over all that he had,' to swear and go on a mission to find a wife
     for Isaac. While his name isn't given in this verse, the connection to
     Genesis 15:2 leads scholars and tradition to recognize him as Eliezer of
     Damascus.</span></li>
</ul>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Montserrat'>Thus, the servant in Genesis 24 is understood to be
Eliezer of Damascus, the trusted heir and manager of Abraham's household, even
though his name is not directly stated in the chapter.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
font-family:Montserrat'>In summary, <b>Eliezer of Damascus</b> was not only a
faithful servant but also the expected heir of Abraham's household due to
Abraham's childlessness at that time. However, with the fulfillment of God's
promise through Isaac's birth, the covenant and inheritance were passed on to
Isaac, the child of promise.</span></p>
