<h4>Creation in Genesis</h4>

<p>The Hebrew word for "created" in Genesis, the word <strong>בָּרָא (bara)</strong>, is unique because it is used exclusively for God’s creative acts.</p>

<p>In Genesis 1, <strong>bara</strong> appears three key times:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Genesis 1:1</strong> – "In the beginning, God created (<strong>בָּרָא</strong>) the heavens and the earth."</li>
  <li><strong>Genesis 1:21</strong> – "So God created (<strong>בָּרָא</strong>) the great sea creatures and every living thing with which the water teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, and every winged bird according to its kind..."</li>
  <li><strong>Genesis 1:27</strong> – "So God created (<strong>בָּרָא</strong>) man in His own image…"</li>
</ul>

<p>Each time, it signifies a new, divine act of creation—something completely new that didn’t exist before. The rest of Genesis 1 often uses <strong>עָשָׂה (asah)</strong>, meaning "to make" or "fashion" from existing material, rather than <strong>bara</strong>, which implies bringing into being from nothing (<em>ex nihilo</em>).</p>

<p>God created the universe in the beginning, and then formed ("manufactured") everything else from the building blocks He had created. Our scientific understanding delves into the glorious works of God. This understanding does not contradict or aim to expose God; rather, it helps us continue fulfilling the first job of subduing the earth and naming every creature.</p>

<h4>Genesis 2:7</h4>

<p>Genesis 2:7 states:</p>

<blockquote>"Then the LORD God formed (<strong>יָצַר, yatsar</strong>) the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living creature."</blockquote>

<p>This verse uses <strong>yatsar</strong> instead of <strong>bara</strong>, meaning "to form" or "shape," like a potter working with clay. This suggests that while Genesis 1:27 (where God "created" man) emphasizes the origin of humanity as a divine act, Genesis 2:7 zooms in to show how God did it—by forming Adam from pre-existing material (dust).</p>

<h4>How Does This Relate to <em>Ex Nihilo</em>?</h4>

<p>Genesis 1:1 establishes that God created everything from nothing (<em>ex nihilo</em>). Before creation, there was no dust, no earth—only God.</p>

<p>By Genesis 2:7, God is working with material that already exists (the dust), but that material itself originally came from God's <em>ex nihilo</em> creation in Genesis 1:1.</p>

<p>Therefore, in my view, Genesis 1:1 does not contradict Genesis 2:7—it simply describes a different stage in God's creative process.</p>
