<h1>Context for Taking a Woman Into Your Household in Genesis 20</h1>

<p>In the ancient Near Eastern context, "taking a woman into your household" typically referred to marriage or concubinage. Kings and rulers often took women into their households as wives, concubines, or members of their harem. This was common in royal courts, where marriage alliances were used for political, social, and economic benefits.</p>

<h2>Specific Context in Genesis 20</h2>
<p>In the case of Abimelech, when he took Sarah into his household, it likely meant he intended to make her a wife or concubine. However, before any physical relations took place, God intervened through a dream, warning Abimelech that Sarah was already married to Abraham.</p>

<blockquote>
  This aligns with similar events in <strong>Genesis 12</strong>, where Pharaoh took Sarah into his palace under the false assumption that she was unmarried, only to later return her after divine intervention.
</blockquote>

<h2>Why Did Kings Do This?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Political Alliances:</strong> Marrying or taking a woman into the household could strengthen ties between different groups or rulers.</li>
  <li><strong>Cultural Norms:</strong> Powerful men often had multiple wives and concubines, reflecting wealth and status.</li>
  <li><strong>Protection for Women:</strong> In some cases, women without male protectors could be taken into a household for security, though this often came with expectations of marriage or servitude.</li>
</ul>

<p>In Genesis 20, Abrahamâ€™s fear that powerful men might kill him to take Sarah shows that such practices were common, and that claiming she was his sister was a survival strategy (though misleading).</p>
