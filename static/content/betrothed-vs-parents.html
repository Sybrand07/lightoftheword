<h4>Does 1 Corinthians 7:36 Refer to a Betrothed Man or Parents?</h4>

<p>1 Corinthians 7:36 has been interpreted in two main ways, depending on the translation and context:</p>

<h4>1. Betrothed (Engaged Couple) Interpretation</h4>

<p>Some translations, like the NIV, ESV, and NASB, interpret "anyone" in verse 36 as referring to a man who is engaged to a woman. In this view, Paul is addressing a fiancÃ© who may be struggling with whether to proceed with marriage.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the couple is growing older and feeling the natural desire to be together, it's not sinful to marry.</li>
  <li>However, if they have the self-control to remain single, that is even better.</li>
</ul>

ðŸ’¡ <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>The previous verses discuss single vs. married devotion to God (<em>v. 32-35</em>).</li>
  <li>Verse 37 talks about a man who has decided not to marryâ€”which makes more sense if he's engaged.</li>
  <li>Paul contrasts marrying vs. not marrying, which fits a betrothal situation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Parents Giving Their Daughter in Marriage</h4>

<p>Some translations, like the KJV and NKJV, suggest that Paul is referring to a father deciding whether to give his daughter in marriage. In this view:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A father who feels that keeping his daughter unmarried is unfair (maybe she's getting older) should allow the marriage.</li>
  <li>If a father is convinced his daughter is content being single, then keeping her unmarried is okay.</li>
</ul>

ðŸ’¡ <strong>Supporting Evidence:</strong>

<ul>
  <li>In ancient culture, parents often arranged marriages for their daughters.</li>
  <li>The Greek phrase "acting improperly toward his virgin" could refer to a fatherâ€™s decision about his daughter.</li>
  <li>Some scholars argue that Paul is giving fathers permission to either allow marriage or keep their daughters single.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Which Interpretation Is Correct?</h4>

<p>The "betrothed" interpretation (engaged man) is more widely accepted today because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The passage flows better if Paul is speaking to engaged couples (<em>v. 32-38</em>).</li>
  <li>In Greek, the words for "virgin" and "man" in <em>v. 36-37</em> make more sense as referring to a fiancÃ©.</li>
  <li>Paulâ€™s emphasis throughout 1 Corinthians 7 is on personal decisions about marriage, not parental control.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, the "father" interpretation was more common in earlier centuries when arranged marriages were the norm.</p>

<h4>Final Answer:</h4>

<p>Most modern scholars and translations take verse 36 as referring to a betrothed man, but the father interpretation is possible depending on cultural context.</p>
