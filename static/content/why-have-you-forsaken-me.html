<h4>Why did Jesus say "My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?"</h4>

<p>When Jesus cried out, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" (<em>Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34</em>), He was quoting Psalm 22:1, a prophetic psalm written by David. This cry expresses the weight of what Jesus was enduring on the cross.</p>

<h4>Why Did Jesus Say This?</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>He Was Fulfilling Prophecy</strong>
    <p>Psalm 22 is a messianic psalm that foretells the suffering of the Christ. By quoting it, Jesus was pointing to its fulfillment in His crucifixion. The psalm describes details of His suffering, such as people mocking Him (<em>Psalm 22:7-8</em>), His hands and feet being pierced (<em>Psalm 22:16</em>), and soldiers casting lots for His garments (<em>Psalm 22:18</em>).</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>He Bore the Full Weight of Sin</strong>
    <p>On the cross, Jesus became the sin-bearer for humanity. <em>2 Corinthians 5:21</em> says, "God made Him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in Him we might become the righteousness of God." At that moment, Jesus was experiencing the consequence of sinâ€”separation from Godâ€”which is what all sinners would face without His sacrifice.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>He Was Experiencing Abandonment in His Humanity</strong>
    <p>Jesus, in His human nature, felt the depth of suffering and alienation as He took on the punishment for sin. This was not because God the Father stopped loving Him, but because in bearing our sins, Jesus was experiencing the forsakenness that sin brings. <em>Habakkuk 1:13</em> says God is too pure to look on evil, and in that moment, Jesus took on the full wrath of God against sin.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>Did the Father Actually Forsake Jesus?</h4>

<p>While Jesus felt forsaken, the Father never truly abandoned Him in a relational sense. Jesus was still the beloved Son of God, but He was experiencing the consequences of sin on behalf of all humanity. The moment of suffering was necessary so that we would never have to be forsaken by God.</p>

<p>After the suffering of Psalm 22, the psalm shifts to victory and deliverance, just as Jesus' story moves from the cross to resurrection. His cry of forsakenness made way for our reconciliation with God, fulfilling His promise in <em>Hebrews 13:5</em>, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."</p>

<h4>In Short:</h4>

<p>Jesus was forsaken so that we never have to be. His temporary suffering on the cross secured our eternal fellowship with God. ðŸ™Œ</p>
