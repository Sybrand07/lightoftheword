<h4>How Long was a Biblical Year?</h4>
<p>The Bible likely used a lunar-based calendar or a 360-day year when recording ages, but it depends on the historical period and context. Here's what we know:</p>

<h4>1. Evidence of a 360-Day Year in the Bible</h4>
<p>The Bible sometimes describes months as 30 days long and a full year as 12 months × 30 days = 360 days.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Genesis 7:11, 7:24, 8:3-4 (The Flood account)</strong><br>
      The Flood lasted 150 days from the 17th day of the 2nd month to the 17th day of the 7th month—exactly 5 months of 30 days each.</li>
  <li><strong>Daniel 7:25 & Revelation 12:6, 12:14, 13:5</strong><br>
      Prophetic "times, time, and half a time" (3.5 years) = 1,260 days → This assumes a 360-day year (3.5 × 360 = 1,260).</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Did This Apply to People’s Ages?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The ages given in Genesis (e.g., Adam 930 years, Noah 950 years, Methuselah 969 years) follow a consistent pattern across generations.</li>
  <li>If the biblical authors were using a 360-day year, it would mean lifespans were measured slightly differently than our modern 365.24-day solar year, but there's no direct evidence that ages were adjusted for a different year length.</li>
</ul>

<h4>3. Transition to a 365-Day Year</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Over time, civilizations like the Egyptians and Babylonians transitioned to a 365-day solar calendar.</li>
  <li>The Hebrews later adopted a lunar-solar calendar (12 lunar months + leap months to align with the solar year).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>The 360-day year appears in some biblical calculations, but whether people’s lifespans were counted using this system remains unclear.</p>
<p>Even if they used a 360-day year, the Bible records ages consistently, meaning the numbers are still meaningful relative to each other.</p>
