<h1>The Connection Between John 14 and God Dwelling with Men (Revelation 21:3, Exodus 25:8, Ezekiel 37:27)</h1>

<p>In <strong>John 14</strong>, Jesus speaks of preparing a place for His disciples and promises that the Father and the Son will make their dwelling with those who love Him. This is deeply connected to the <strong>biblical theme of God dwelling with humanity</strong>, which is seen throughout Scripture—from the <strong>tabernacle in Exodus</strong> to the <strong>New Jerusalem in Revelation</strong>.</p>

<h2>1. John 14 and the Promise of Divine Dwelling</h2>

<h3>John 14:1-3 – The Heavenly Dwelling Place</h3>
<blockquote>
    "Let not your heart be troubled: ye believe in God, believe also in me. In my Father’s house are many mansions: if it were not so, I would have told you. I go to prepare a place for you." (John 14:1-3)
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus is preparing <strong>a permanent dwelling place</strong> for believers in the Father's house. This suggests <strong>a restored relationship</strong> where humans will dwell fully with God.</p>

<h3>John 14:23 – The Present Reality of Divine Indwelling</h3>
<blockquote>
    "If a man love me, he will keep my words: and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him." (John 14:23)
</blockquote>

<p>Jesus is not only speaking about a <strong>future dwelling in heaven</strong> but also about the <strong>immediate indwelling of God through the Holy Spirit</strong>. The Greek word for "abode" (μονή, monē) is the same as “mansions” in John 14:2, meaning <strong>God’s presence begins to dwell within believers even now</strong>.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong> Jesus’ promise in <strong>John 14:23</strong> is a <strong>partial fulfillment</strong> of God's desire to <strong>dwell with His people</strong>—which will reach its climax in <strong>Revelation 21:3</strong>.</p>

<h2>2. The Old Testament Pattern: God Dwelling with Israel</h2>

<h3>Exodus 25:8 – The Tabernacle as God's Dwelling</h3>
<blockquote>
    "And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them." (Exodus 25:8)
</blockquote>

<p>God’s first dwelling among men was through the <strong>Tabernacle</strong>, symbolizing His desire for <strong>intimacy with His people</strong>. This temporary dwelling pointed forward to <strong>Jesus’ coming (John 1:14)</strong> and the indwelling of the <strong>Holy Spirit (John 14:17)</strong>.</p>

<h3>Ezekiel 37:27 – The Future Promise of God Dwelling</h3>
<blockquote>
    "My dwelling place will be with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people." (Ezekiel 37:27)
</blockquote>

<p>This prophecy anticipates <strong>a permanent, unbreakable union</strong> between God and His people. <strong>John 14:23</strong> begins to fulfill this as the Father and Son come to dwell in believers <strong>through the Spirit</strong>.</p>

<br>
<p><strong>Key Connection:</strong> 
    <ul>
        <li><strong>The Tabernacle (Exodus 25:8) → Jesus (John 1:14) → The Holy Spirit (John 14:23) → New Jerusalem (Revelation 21:3)</strong></li>
        <li>God <strong>first dwelt with Israel</strong> in a tent, then <strong>in Jesus</strong>, now <strong>in believers</strong>, and <strong>one day fully and visibly in the New Creation</strong>.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>3. The Final Fulfillment: Revelation 21:3</h2>

<h3>Revelation 21:3 – The Eternal Dwelling of God</h3>
<blockquote>
    "And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them, and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with them, and be their God." (Revelation 21:3)
</blockquote>

<p>This is the <strong>final and ultimate fulfillment</strong> of Jesus’ promise in <strong>John 14</strong>. In the New Jerusalem, believers will <strong>see God face to face</strong> and dwell with Him forever.</p>
<br>

<p><strong>Key Insight:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>John 14:2 → Jesus prepares a place for believers</strong></li>
        <li><strong>John 14:23 → God already dwells in us through the Spirit</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Revelation 21:3 → God will fully dwell among His people forever</strong></li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h2>4. How Does This Apply to Us Today?</h2>


    <li><strong>God's Presence is Already in Us</strong>
        <p>Through the <strong>Holy Spirit</strong>, we experience the reality of <strong>God dwelling in us now</strong> (<strong>John 14:23</strong>). Our <strong>daily walk with Christ</strong> is a foretaste of the <strong>eternal dwelling to come</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <br>

    <li><strong>The Church as God’s Dwelling Place</strong>
        <p><strong>1 Corinthians 3:16</strong>: "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?"</p>
        <p>We are collectively <strong>God’s tabernacle on earth</strong>.</p>
    </li>
    <br>

    <li><strong>The Future Hope of Seeing God Face to Face</strong>
        <p>The <strong>Holy Spirit</strong> is a <strong>guarantee</strong> of our <strong>future dwelling with God</strong> (<strong>Ephesians 1:13-14</strong>). One day, we will experience <strong>full communion with God</strong> in the New Jerusalem (<strong>Revelation 22:4</strong> – "They shall see His face").</p>
    </li>
