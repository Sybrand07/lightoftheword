<h1>Signs of the End of Temple Sacrifices after 30 AD in the Talmud</h1>

<p>In the years leading up to the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 AD, significant events in Jewish rituals and the Temple's operations were seen as signs that God had ceased to accept the sacrifices. These events, recorded in the Talmud, coincide with the period of Jesus’ crucifixion (around 30 AD). The following Talmudic references highlight some of these signs of divine disfavor.</p>

<h2>1. The Scarlet Thread and the Menorah’s Miracle</h2>

<h3>The Scarlet Thread</h3>
  <p><strong>Talmudic Reference:</strong> <em>Yoma 39b</em></p>
  <p><strong>Ritual:</strong> A scarlet thread was tied to the Temple doors on Yom Kippur. If God accepted the atoning sacrifice, the thread would turn white, symbolizing divine forgiveness.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure:</strong> From approximately <strong>30 AD</strong>, the thread no longer turned white during the Yom Kippur ritual. This failure continued in the years that followed, particularly as the Temple’s destruction approached in <strong>70 AD</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The failure of the scarlet thread to turn white in the decades leading up to the destruction of the Temple signaled that God no longer accepted the Temple sacrifices.</p>

<h3>The Menorah’s Oil</h3>
  <p><strong>Talmudic Reference:</strong> <em>Yoma 39b</em></p>
  <p><strong>Ritual:</strong> The Menorah, a seven-branched lampstand, was lit in the Temple with oil that miraculously replenished itself.</p>
  <p><strong>Failure:</strong> This miracle ceased in the years before the Temple's destruction, beginning around <strong>30 AD</strong> and continuing until <strong>70 AD</strong>.</p>
  <p><strong>Significance:</strong> The cessation of the Menorah’s miraculous oil replenishment indicated the withdrawal of God’s favor from the sacrificial system.</p>

<h2>2. The Scapegoat and Sacrificial Goat</h2>

<h3>The Ritual</h3>

  <p><strong>Talmudic Reference:</strong> <em>Yoma 39a</em></p>
  <p><strong>Ritual Description:</strong> On Yom Kippur, two goats were chosen: one to be sacrificed for sin, and the other to be sent into the wilderness as the scapegoat, symbolizing the bearing of the people's sins.</p>


<h3>Failures in the Ritual</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>The Scapegoat:</strong> In the years before <strong>70 AD</strong>, particularly from <strong>30 AD</strong> onwards, the scapegoat often failed to reach the wilderness or was caught before being sent away, an anomaly in the ritual.</li>
  <li><strong>The Sacrificial Goat:</strong> From approximately <strong>30 AD</strong>, there were frequent instances where the sacrificial goat was found unfit, such as being physically defective.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Significance of Failure</h3>

  <p>The failure of these key rituals, notably beginning around the time of Jesus' crucifixion in <strong>30 AD</strong>, was seen as a sign of divine rejection of the sacrificial system. The continual failures in the goat selection process symbolized that the Temple sacrifices were no longer effective.</p>


<h2>3. Instability in the High Priesthood</h2>

<h3>Corruption in the High Priesthood</h3>

  <p><strong>Talmudic Reference:</strong> <em>Yoma 9b</em>, <em>Yoma 39a</em></p>
  <p><strong>Issue:</strong> By <strong>30 AD</strong>, the High Priesthood had become increasingly corrupt, with priests often appointed for political reasons rather than spiritual qualifications. This corruption continued to worsen throughout the years leading up to the destruction of the Temple.</p>
  <p><strong>Significance:</strong> From <strong>30 AD</strong> onward, the position of High Priest was often bought and sold, and the priests were seen as politically motivated rather than spiritually legitimate. This instability in the priesthood undermined the integrity of the sacrificial system.</p>


<h2>4. The Departure of the Divine Presence (Shekinah)</h2>

<h3>God’s Presence in the Temple</h3>

  <p><strong>Talmudic Reference:</strong> <em>Yoma 39a</em></p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Shekinah, or divine presence, was believed to dwell in the Holy of Holies in the Temple.</p>


<h3>Absence of the Shekinah</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Failure to Appear:</strong> In the years before the destruction of the Temple, around <strong>30 AD</strong> and continuing until <strong>70 AD</strong>, the Shekinah’s presence was no longer manifest in the Temple. This marked a significant sign that God had withdrawn His favor.</li>
  <li><strong>Significance:</strong> The absence of the Shekinah was seen as a symbol that the Temple, and its sacrifices, were no longer the rightful means of atonement for Israel.</li>
</ul>

  </tr>
</table>

<h3>Significance</h3>

  <p>The failure of these miracles, particularly from <strong>30 AD</strong> onwards, was seen as a sign that God was no longer accepting the rituals and sacrifices performed in the Temple.</p>


<h2>6. Messianic Expectations and the Shift in Salvation</h2>

<h3>The Messianic Hope</h3>

  <p><strong>Talmudic Reference:</strong> <em>Sanhedrin 97b</em></p>
  <p><strong>Description:</strong> The Talmud speaks of the Jewish people's longing for the Messiah, especially in the years leading up to the destruction of the Temple. While the Talmud does not accept Jesus as the Messiah, it acknowledges the widespread hope for a savior.</p>


<h3>Significance of the Shift</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Christian Interpretation:</strong> Christians view Jesus as the fulfillment of messianic prophecies. His death, around <strong>30 AD</strong>, is seen as the ultimate atoning sacrifice, which made the Temple sacrifices obsolete.</li>
  <li><strong>Talmudic Reference to the Need for Change:</strong> The Talmud’s acknowledgment of the need for a Messiah highlights the dissatisfaction with the current sacrificial system and the anticipation of a new form of salvation, which Christians believe was fulfilled in Jesus.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>While the Talmud does not explicitly declare that God rejected the sacrifices after <strong>30 AD</strong>, the records in the Talmud of several key failures, particularly in the years leading up to <strong>70 AD</strong>, indicate divine disfavor with the Temple sacrifices. These signs, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The failure of the scarlet thread to turn white,</li>
  <li>The cessation of the Menorah oil miracle,</li>
  <li>Failures in the scapegoat and sacrificial goat ritual,</li>
  <li>Instability in the High Priesthood,</li>
  <li>The absence of the Shekinah,</li>
  <li>The cessation of miraculous events such as the Temple gates opening,</li>
</ul>

<p>These signs point to the conclusion that God was no longer accepting the Temple sacrifices, aligning with the Christian belief that Jesus’ crucifixion in <strong>30 AD</strong> marked the end of the old covenant and the beginning of the new covenant through Him.</p>
