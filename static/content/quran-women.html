<h1>How Does the Quran Portray the Role of a Wife?</h1>
    
<p>The Quran portrays the role of a wife as a partner, source of comfort, and a significant part of the family unit. It highlights mutual love, mercy, and cooperation between husband and wife, while also addressing responsibilities and rights in marriage.</p>

<h2>1. The Wife as a Companion and Source of Tranquility</h2>
<p>The Quran presents marriage as a divine sign of God’s mercy, where spouses provide peace and comfort to each other:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quran 30:21</strong></p>
    <p>“And among His signs is that He created for you from yourselves spouses that you may find tranquility in them, and He placed between you affection and mercy. Indeed, in that are signs for a people who reflect.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This verse emphasizes love, emotional support, and mutual kindness, rather than dominance or superiority.</p>

<p>Similarly, the Quran states that husbands and wives are garments for one another, symbolizing protection, closeness, and intimacy:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quran 2:187</strong></p>
    <p>“…They are a garment for you, and you are a garment for them.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This reflects equality in emotional and physical support within marriage.</p>

<h2>2. The Wife’s Role in the Household</h2>
<p>While the Quran does not assign rigid gender roles, it acknowledges that men are generally expected to be providers while wives manage the household:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quran 4:34</strong></p>
    <p>“Men are the protectors and maintainers of women because Allah has given some of them more (strength) than others, and because they spend (to support them) from their wealth.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This verse is often debated, but it does not imply female inferiority—instead, it highlights the husband’s duty to provide for and take care of his wife. Islamic scholars argue that a wife’s financial support is her husband's responsibility, even if she earns her own income.</p>

<h2>3. The Wife’s Rights and Responsibilities</h2>
<p>The Quran promotes mutual rights between husbands and wives:</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quran 2:228</strong></p>
    <p>“…And women have rights similar to their obligations, according to what is equitable…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This means a wife has equal dignity and worth in marriage.</p>

<h3>A. Right to Fair Treatment</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quran 4:19</strong></p>
    <p>“…Live with them in kindness (ma’ruf). For if you dislike them, perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This verse discourages mistreatment and encourages patience and understanding in marriage.</p>

<h3>B. Right to Financial Support</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quran 65:6-7</strong></p>
    <p>“Let the rich man spend according to his means, and the man whose resources are restricted, let him spend according to what Allah has given him…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Even after divorce, the husband must support his ex-wife financially for a certain period.</p>

<h3>C. Right to Consent in Marriage</h3>
<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quran 4:19</strong></p>
    <p>“O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This shows that a wife must freely accept the marriage, rejecting forced unions.</p>

<h2>4. Divorce and the Wife’s Protection</h2>
<p>While divorce is permitted, it is discouraged and must be handled with respect and fairness.</p>

<blockquote>
    <p><strong>Quran 2:231</strong></p>
    <p>“And when you divorce women and they reach their term, either retain them in kindness or release them with kindness…”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A wife has the right to seek divorce (khul’) if she is unhappy, and Islam requires fair treatment during and after separation.</p>
