                        <h3>Light of the Word: Prayer Chart</h3>
                        <p>
                            This intricate artwork, titled <strong>"Light of the Word,"</strong> is more than just a visual representation—it serves as a <strong>prayer chart</strong>, urging believers to speak life over themselves, to be washed and renewed by the Word of God. At its center is a circular design, reminiscent of an eye, framed by a radiant spectrum of colors that mirrors God's covenant with humanity, as seen in the rainbow after the flood (Genesis 9:13). The central point, dark yet powerful, symbolizes the infinite and incomprehensible nature of God (Romans 11:33).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Surrounding this focal point are words of Scripture and spiritual truths that radiate outward like beams of light, reflecting the truth of God's Word: <strong>"Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path"</strong> (Psalm 119:105). These concepts—<strong>Praise & Worship, Eternal Word, Promises, Encouragement, Prayer and Faith, Kindness and Compassion, Faith and Action, Divine Nature, Care and Support, Wisdom and Conduct</strong>—are vital for speaking life over oneself. As believers declare these truths, they are reminded of the transformative power of the Word, in alignment with Jesus’ promise: <strong>"I am the light of the world. Whoever follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life"</strong> (John 8:12).

                        <h3>The Glory of it All</h3>
                        <p>
                            This love-inspired canvas, titled <strong>"The Glory of it All,"</strong> presents a vivid and symbolic portrayal of the cross of Jesus Christ, meticulously designed from <strong>'diamonds.'</strong> Each diamond is unique, reflecting the light in different ways, symbolizing the diversity and individuality of those redeemed by Christ’s sacrifice. Just as diamonds, despite their imperfections and inclusions, still shine with brilliance, so too do believers. We are redeemed by the blood of Christ, with all our imperfections, and through His grace, His light shines through us (Ephesians 2:10; 1 Peter 2:24). The diamonds represent the lives of believers, precious in His sight, each one purposed for His glory. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the very center of the cross is Jesus, depicted with the <strong>throne of God</strong>, which is beautifully described in Ezekiel 1:26-28: "And above the firmament over their heads was the likeness of a throne, in appearance like a sapphire stone; on the likeness of the throne was a likeness with the appearance of a man high above it... Like the appearance of a rainbow in a cloud on a rainy day, so was the appearance of the brightness all around it. This was the appearance of the likeness of the glory of the Lord." This is a powerful representation of Jesus at the center of our faith, and at the center of the throne of God in heaven, radiating glory and majesty (Revelation 4:2-3). His position at the center signifies His role as the cornerstone of our salvation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Surrounding the cross are powerful biblical symbols. The <strong>four living creatures</strong>, described in Ezekiel 1 and Revelation 4, encircle the throne. These creatures, resembling burning coals of fire and lightning, represent the power and holiness of God. Their presence in this artwork highlights the awe-inspiring nature of God's creation and His celestial order, as they constantly worship the Lord, declaring, “Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, Who was and is and is to come!” (Revelation 4:8). Their representation as slightly larger precious gems in the design underscores their heavenly nature and eternal presence around God’s throne.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The <strong>24 elders</strong>, depicted as diamonds around the throne, symbolize the redeemed humanity (Revelation 4:4). Each elder is clothed in white robes and crowned with gold, representing purity and victory through Christ. These elders are a reminder of the believers who will one day reign with Christ, casting their crowns before Him in worship, just as described in Revelation 4:10-11: “They cast their crowns before the throne, saying: ‘You are worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honor and power; for You created all things, and by Your will they exist and were created.’” The artwork visually reflects this act of humility and worship.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Another significant feature is the depiction of the <strong>breastplate of judgment</strong> at the chest position of the cross. This breastplate, adorned with 12 precious stones, represents the 12 tribes of Israel and echoes the design described in Exodus 28:15-21. As Jesus is our High Priest (Hebrews 9:11), the breastplate of judgment belongs to Him, bearing the names of the tribes, signifying His role as the intercessor between God and His people. This element of the artwork is a profound reminder of Jesus’ priestly role and the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy through His life, death, and resurrection.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At the base of the cross, <strong>foundation stones</strong> symbolize the foundations of the New Jerusalem as described in Revelation 21:14, 19-21. These twelve stones, including jasper, sapphire, and amethyst, are a visual representation of the eternal city that God has prepared for His people. The rainbow backdrop further symbolizes God’s covenant promise, as seen in Genesis 9:13, reminding us of His faithfulness and grace. In the artwork, this serves as a backdrop to the cross, aligning the imagery with the biblical vision of God’s eternal kingdom.

                        <h3>The Word revealed.</h3>
                        <p>
                            This intricate artwork, titled <strong>"The Word revealed,"</strong> presents a captivating visual representation of Biblical truth. The design consists of concentric circles made entirely from Scripture, reflecting the eternal nature of God's Word: <strong>"Heaven and earth will pass away, but My words will never pass away"</strong> (Matthew 24:35). The central point, dark and mysterious, symbolizes the unsearchable depth of God's wisdom and knowledge (Romans 11:33).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Surrounding the center, biblical verses radiate outward like beams of light, inviting the viewer to meditate on the richness of God's revelation. Each circle of text represents an unfolding layer of spiritual truth, reminding us that <strong>"The unfolding of Your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple"</strong> (Psalm 119:130). This artwork encourages believers to be washed by the Word and to speak life over themselves through the living power of Scripture.
